# IBM capstone project repo
This repo demonstrates curiousdata's data science skills.

It holds all labs related to a capstone project, a grand finale of a 10-course IBM Data Science specialization.

Every step of data science journey within one project is included, starting with data collection and web scraping, and ending with creation of ML models and presentation of the findings.

Python and SQL are used for this project. In Python, several libraries are used throughout the project, mainly: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash.
